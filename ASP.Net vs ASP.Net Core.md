# Difference between ASP.NET Core 5 and ASP.NET MVC 5

### Asp.Net Core
ASP.Net core is a much-upgraded version since it combines apart from ASP.NET MVC also ASP.NET, ASP.NET Web API and ASP.NET web pages.
It combines all of them into a single programming model.


1. Single aligned web stack for ASP.NET Core MVC and Web APIs
    - ASP.NET MVC 5 will allow us to choose MVC or Web API or both while creating a web application. It was because the web stack for MVC 5 and Web API are different. ASP.NET Core 5 now has a single-aligned web stack for MVC and Web API.
2. Project (Solution) Structure Changes
    - If you see ASP.NET Core 5 MVC solution explorer on the right-hand side, there is no Web.config, Global.asax.
Then how it deals with configuration settings, authentication and application start specific code execution.    

3. As ASP.NET Core is almost a combination of NET frameworks, app developers can still run the apps on NET Core even with NET Frameworks.
