# Differences between .Net Core and .Net Framework

 * .Net Framework is a software development framework designed and maintained by the tech giant Microsoft.
 *  It is Windows-based and primarily runs on Windows devices.
 *  It is used for the development of standalone desktop as well as web applications. 
 *  The framework provides all the basic requirements for the development of applications â€“ UI, DB connectivity, Services, APIs, etc

Core
* .Net Core is an open-source Development Platform designed and maintained by Microsoft and the .Net community. 
* Net Core has been designed, keeping in mind various needs and purposes, focusing on Web Development, Windows Phone Development, and Windows Store Apps Development.

1. They both share a common set of libraries essential for any application to run. 
2.  This hardly changes and is thus the base for all .Net stack frameworks.

### .NET Framework is a better choice if you:
1. Do not have time to learn new technology.
2. Need a stable environment to work in.
3. Have nearer release schedules.
4. We are already working on an existing app and extending its functionality.
5. Already have an existing team with .NET expertise and building production-ready software.
6. Do not want to deal with continuous upgrades and changes.
7. Building Windows client applications using Windows Forms or WPF(Windows Presentation Foundation )

### .NET Core is a better choice if you:
1. Want to target your apps on Windows, Linux, and Mac operating systems.
2. Are not afraid of learning new things.
3. Are not afraid of breaking and fixing things since .NET Core is not fully matured yet.
4. A student who is just learning .NET.

## Conclusion 

.Net Core when it is just a subset of the .Net Framework. .Net core has some fundamental changes to the way it operates. First and foremost, it is more modularized. This helps you create applications with only the libraries you need and no extra baggage. Second, it is truly cross-platform. This makes it the choice of development platform of the future.
